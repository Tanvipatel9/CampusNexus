# CampusNexus: Centralized Resource Hub for UofT Students

## Introduction

CampusNexus is a high-fidelity prototype designed to address a common challenge faced by students at the University of Toronto (UofT): the fragmentation and loss of important information and opportunities across multiple channels. Our app aims to centralize resources and streamline access to vital information, enabling students to maximize their academic, extracurricular, career development, and wellbeing experiences.

## Problem Statement

Current UofT students often struggle with losing important information, resources, and opportunities due to their dispersion across various channels. This issue arises from the tendency for information to become scattered and forgotten among numerous deadlines and sources. As a result, students may miss out on valuable resources and facilities that could enhance their university experience.

## Our Solution

CampusNexus serves as a comprehensive platform designed to consolidate a wide range of resources into a single, accessible hub. Built using Figma, our high-fidelity prototype offers a user-centric design that emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and functionality. The app aims to provide a one-stop destination where students can easily find and engage with various campus resources.
