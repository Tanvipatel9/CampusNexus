Current UofT students are losing important information, resources, and opportunities
among multiple channels through which they receive them. This is a prominent issue among
university students due to the tendency for information to be lost or forgotten in their cluster of
information and deadlines. We are addressing the concern that due to the scattering of
information, students are unable to benefit from the resources and facilities available to them.
This is an obstacle that prevents them from getting the most out of their academic studies,
extracurriculars, career development and wellbeing.
